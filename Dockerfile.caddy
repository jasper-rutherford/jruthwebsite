# We're using the old Caddy (v2.6.4) because the caddy-dns/godaddy plugin isn't compatible with newer Caddy versionsâ€”it expects older libdns.Record fields that got removed later.

# and then the old caddy gets grumpy when used with newer golang versions. so we have to use an old golang too. 

# aaaaaaand then xcaddy doesnt like old go. so we need old xcaddy.
